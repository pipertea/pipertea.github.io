<section>
<h2>What is the difference between absolute and relative CSS length unit?</h2>
<p>The difference between absolute and relative CSS length unit is that absolute units are fixed and independent of other elements on the screen, while relative units use scaling in relation to other factors that are on display. For example, pixels or inches relate to the physical unit, always.</p>

Listed Units:
    <ul>em, rem: Relative to the font size of the root element which helps in scaling perfect layouts</ul>
    <ul>cap, ex, ch: Relative to the x-height of the current font but is rarely used</ul>
    <ul>vw, vh: Relative to 1% of the width or the height of the browser window size</ul>
