    <h1>Code Log 1: HTML Semantic Tags</h1>
    
<section>
<h1>What is the difference between non-semantic and semantic tags in HTML?</h1>
<p>The difference between non-semantic and semantic tags in HTML is that non-semantic tags provide absolutely nothing about the content in code while semantic tags give both the developer and the web browser a clearer understanding of the web's content. For example, non-semantic tags could be things such as <textarea>div</textarea> or <textarea>span</textarea>, which fails to tell the browser what it represents. Semantic tags or elements could be <textarea>img</textarea> or <textarea>table</textarea>. It is essentially code made easy to understand.</p>

<h1>What are two (or more) benefits of using semantic tags?</h1>
<p>Some benefits of using semantic tags are one, it is much easier to read without having much to look at, and two, it kind of feeds into the same idea of greater accessibility. There are a variety of web users and making the code easier to read makes the entire process a much smoother and more enjoyable experience.</p>
